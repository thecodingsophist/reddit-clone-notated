# reddit-clone-notated
This is a second go round for the reddit clone taught by Make School. In this version I keep extensive notes on every line of code to help convey understanding of how the reddit-clone was built and the technologies used.

Follow the Make School tutorial at: https://www.makeschool.com/academy/track/reddit-clone-in-node-js/tutorial/

PROGRESS TRACKER: 

1/29 3:30 - 5:00 p.m

In this project I will follow Make School’s tutorial to make a reddit clone. I will (continue to) learn to use Node.js write Javascript functions , Express.js for rendering a template server side, MongoDB & Mongoose (ODM) as the database, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate login and users. (via Dani Roxberry)

Note: npm stands for node package manager and works like the pip install for python, but for Node.js necessities. 

First steps: I need to set up Express.js and get the “Hello World” running on localhost: 3000. 

I copied and pasted the code from: https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html, which are the first few lines of code that goes in the document. See comments in that file for a line by line explanation of how to set up an node and express project. 

1/30 11:45 - 12:00 p.m

Finish explaining how to do “Hello World” in express node. 

2/4 11:00 - 12:05 p.m 

Getting back into node and the tutorials after a few days of absence from working on another coding challenge -- which still remains broken :’(

Added Bootstrap to the layout template <head> using CDN (or using a Content Delivery Network)

Go to https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/download/ and scroll down to Bootstrap CDN, copy and paste the code in that section into the header for your html file. 

Use this website to set up res.sendFile: https://scotch.io/tutorials/use-expressjs-to-deliver-html-files

This renders my first bootstrapped page for the project!

2/14 1:00 p.m Changed extension from .html to .hbs (which doesn't work) to .handlebars
